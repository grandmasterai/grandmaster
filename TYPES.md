# TYPES

- Preferably, every input or output should have only one canonical type representation.
- For instance, transcriptions can be represented in several ways and formats (.txt, .srt, .vtt). To keep things simple, we return only one type (in this case, VTT, as it is the most generic one that contains more metadata!) and eventually explain the customer how to view that type in a different format ().
- Same for images
